1. Practice deep breathing exercises and mindfulness techniques to help regulate your breathing and calm your mind during moments of heightened anxiety.
2. Engage in regular physical activity, such as yoga or walking, to release tension and promote relaxation.
3. Consider therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to work through underlying triggers and develop coping mechanisms.

Medications to consider based on your condition:
1. Anti-anxiety medications, such as benzodiazepines, may be prescribed for short-term relief of severe anxiety symptoms.
2. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used for long-term management of anxiety disorders.
3. Beta-blockers can be used to control physical symptoms of anxiety, such as rapid heart rate.

I suggest exploring the following resources or activities that may be helpful for you:
- Join a support group for individuals dealing with anxiety to connect with others who understand your experiences.
- Mindfulness meditation apps, like Headspace or Calm, can provide guided sessions to help reduce stress and anxiety.
- Consider keeping a journal to track your triggers and symptoms, which can help identify patterns and develop effective coping strategies.

Additionally, I recommend the following authentic journal articles/publications related to anxiety and panic attacks:
- "The Role of Mindfulness-Based Interventions in the Treatment of Anxiety Disorders" - A review of the efficacy of mindfulness techniques in managing anxiety.
- "Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Panic Disorder" - An overview of CBT strategies specifically tailored for individuals with panic disorder.
- "The Impact of Physical Activity on Mental Health and Anxiety" - Research highlighting the benefits of exercise in managing anxiety symptoms.

Let's work together on implementing these strategies and monitoring your progress. Your well-being is our priority.
